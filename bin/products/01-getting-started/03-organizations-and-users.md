Organizations are a billing entity that sit one level above users and projects.  

Much like with GitHub and other popular SaaS tools, at Packet every user has their own account and infrastructure is deployed into a project.  In the past each Packet project was like an island, with different rates, collaborators, etc.  Even if owned by the same person, setting up a new project meant starting from scratch.

With organizations, you can now own multiple projects all under the same roof.  This makes it easier for power users and companies to organize and scale their work.

There are two types of organizations:
* __Personal__ organizations are meant for individuals  (e.g. personal servers, example projects, or test integrations.)
* __Company__ organizations are tied to a corporate entity and typically involve multiple projects and several collaborators.

Just like at GitHub, you can create or belong to many organizations at once.  

### Team Members and Roles

One of the initial benefits of this feature is the ability to better define and manage collaborators.  
Each organization has a primary owner, who is ultimately responsible for all activity in that organization.  Additional team members can be added with the following permissions:

* __Admin__ - this role is will have full control over the account.
* __Collaborator__ -  will have access to project specific resources.
* __Billing__ - will have access to the billing portion of the account.

### Adding Members to an Organization?

If you are an Owner or an Admin, you can invite new users via the `User Icon > Team > Invite New Member`.

 You are able to add a single member or multiples at once. Each email added, will receive an automated response from our platform with a verification link (to either accept/deny) the invitation.
